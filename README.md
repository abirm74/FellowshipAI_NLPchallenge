## Overview

This GitHub repository contains my solution to the Sentiment Analysis challenge as proposed by FellowshipAI. The project focuses on sentiment analysis using the IMDb movie review dataset, where I have performed various tasks such as text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Text Preprocessing
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [x] Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning
  - [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - [x] XGBoost
  - [x] Logistic Regression

### To-Do Tasks
- [ ] Bag of words
- [ ] Predictive Modeling with Deep Learning
- [ ] Deployment

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

 Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone (https://github.com/abirm74/FellowshipAI_NLPchallenge.git)


## To-Do

### Predictive Modeling with Deep Learning

In this phase of the project, we will explore deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis, such as using neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) models like LSTM or Transformer-based architectures.

### Deployment

The deployment phase involves making the sentiment analysis model accessible through a user-friendly interface. We will deploy the model using a web application or API, allowing users to analyze movie reviews in real-time.
